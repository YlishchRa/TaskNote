This is my second ped project.
This is a simple task note where you can add, delete and update tasks.
It is not finished yet, but at the moment I have created front-end . Also made connect with back-end.
I did not use a database, instead I implemented my own way of storing data.
The TaskService class has a list and methods that help add, delete, and update the list.
I serialize/deserialize this list into a data.xml file.
I also handle errors such as not being able to add a new item to the list and show it to the user.



Updated
after you create a new task, it is displayed in the table

Updated*
implemented the completion of the selected task
